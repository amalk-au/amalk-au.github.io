          <h1>Amal Kariyawasam, Full Stack Software Engineer</h1>

          <p>
            With a career spanning Electronics Engineering and Finance from the
            UK, Sri Lanka to Australia, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective
            to Full Stack Software Engineering. I specialise in solving niche,
            real world problems by bridging complex technical requirements with
            clear, high level business goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach is grounded in the first principles of Engineering,
            building systems that are simple, efficient, and built to last. I
            prioritise foundational web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML,
            and CSS for their performance, clarity, and longevity. On top of
            these fundamentals, I work extensively with modern tools and
            frameworks including React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, using them
            deliberately rather than by default. By understanding what happens
            beneath the abstractions, I build software that is secure,
            resilient, maintainable, and fast by design.
          </p>
          <p>
            This foundation enables me to work effectively in multidisciplinary
            and multicultural teams, collaborating across a wide range of
            business functions from sales and operations to executive
            leadership, and translating complexity into solutions that deliver
            lasting value.
          </p>

        <div class="item">
          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I enjoy building practical, meaningful software, with a strong
              focus on web based applications, which I find both exciting and
              impactful.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am a firm believer in continuous self improvement, whether in
              communication, business, management, or software development. I
              value living in a time where technology, when used ethically, can
              significantly improve people’s lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              I enjoy learning new technologies that enhance productivity, with
              my current focus on using LLM/AI to improve how I work and build
              software.
            </li>
            <li>
              I strongly believe in developing a deep understanding of core web
              technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Frameworks evolve
              and change, but these foundations endure. This belief in
              simplicity and performance is why this website is built without
              frameworks, relying instead on foundational web technologies.

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve developed a range of software and electronics
            projects. The best way to explore them, see how they work, or even
            fork them for your own use is on my
            <a href="https://github.com/amalk-au" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
            account.
