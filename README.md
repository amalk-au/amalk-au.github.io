## Introduction

Responsive personal website built with a focus on base web technologies (semantic HTML, modern CSS, Vanilla JavaScript) and clean code.

In modern web development, it is easy to default to React or Next.js for everything. For this portfolio, I made the intentional engineering decision to stick to Vanilla Web Technologies. Here’s why:

- I find pure joy in building a website that doesn't have an expiration date. While frameworks come and go, the core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are long term. This project is a celebration of the modern web platform’s capabilities proving that with today’s native APIs, the 'complexities' of build tools are often just unwanted friction.

- Modern CSS is a Powerhouse : With the advent of CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables, and functions like clamp(), the layout complexities that once required JavaScript libraries are now natively supported. I wanted to demonstrate that I can build complex, responsive layouts using the browser's native engine.

- Avoiding Unwanted Complexity : For a portfolio, a Virtual DOM is often overkill. Using Vanilla JS allows me to interact directly with the DOM, leading to:

  - Simpler Debugging: No build-step abstractions between the code I write and the code the browser runs.
  - Long term Stability: This site won't break when a framework updates its major version or changes its API. It will work as long as browsers exist.

- Showcasing Fundamentals: Anyone can follow a React tutorial or vibe code a website. Building a professional, accessible, and responsive site with "just" the basics proves a deep understanding of the Web Platform. It shows and make sure I keep myself updated on how the web actually works under the hood.
